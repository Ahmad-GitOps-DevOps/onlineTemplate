1.Default Lifecycle
  Validate It validates that the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
  Compile - It compiles the source code of the project.
  Test - Run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. Normally if they the tests requirements fails
  then the code SHOULD NOT be packaged or deployed.
  package take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, EAR....
  install :
  locally. install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects
  deploy
  projects. copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers 
  
2,Clean Lifecycle:
  clean : remove all files generated by the previous build
  
3,Site Lifecycle
  site generate the project's site documentation
